# 🚖 Uber Homepage Static Clone

This is a **static clone of the Uber homepage** built using pure **HTML and CSS**. The goal of this project was to replicate the layout, styling, and structure of the official Uber site for practice and portfolio building purposes. It includes the hero booking section, feature suggestions, app download cards, and a complete footer.
